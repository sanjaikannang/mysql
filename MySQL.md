## 1. Introduction to MySQL

### What is MySQL?

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. It is widely used for web applications and is a key component of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack.

### History of MySQL

MySQL was created by a Swedish company, MySQL AB, founded by David Axmark, Allan Larsson, and Michael "Monty" Widenius. It was first released in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular databases in the world. MySQL was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008, and later by Oracle Corporation in 2010.

### Features of MySQL

- **Open Source:** MySQL is free to use and modify.
- **Scalable:** Can handle large amounts of data and high traffic.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on various operating systems including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Security:** Offers robust data security and user authentication.
- **Replication:** Supports master-slave replication for high availability.

### MySQL vs. Other Databases

- **MySQL vs. PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is more feature-rich and supports advanced SQL features, while MySQL is known for its speed and ease of use.
- **MySQL vs. SQLite:** SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database, while MySQL is a full-fledged RDBMS.
- **MySQL vs. MongoDB:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database, while MySQL is a relational database.

```

---

## 6. Advanced SQL Queries

### JOINs

- **INNER JOIN:** Returns records with matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN:** Returns all records when there is a match in either table.

```
SELECT users.username, orders.order_id
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

### Subqueries

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders);
```

### UNION and UNION ALL

```
SELECT username FROM users
UNION
SELECT email FROM users;
```

### GROUP BY and HAVING

```
SELECT COUNT(user_id), user_id
FROM orders
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(user_id) > 5;
```

### Aggregate Functions

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```

## 7. Indexes and Optimization

### What are Indexes?

Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of rows from a table. They are similar to the index in a book.

### Creating and Dropping Indexes

```
CREATE INDEX idx_username ON users (username);
DROP INDEX idx_username ON users;
```

### Types of Indexes

- **Primary Index:** Automatically created on the primary key.
- **Unique Index:** Ensures all values in the index are unique.
- **Composite Index:** Index on multiple columns.

### Query Optimization Techniques

- Use indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses.
- Avoid using `SELECT *`.
- Optimize JOIN operations.
- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query performance.

## 8. Stored Procedures and Functions

### Creating Stored Procedures

```
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUser(IN user_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = user_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### Calling Stored Procedures

```
CALL GetUser(1);
```

### Creating Functions

```
DELIMITER //
CREATE FUNCTION GetUserName(user_id INT) RETURNS VARCHAR(50)
BEGIN
    DECLARE username VARCHAR(50);
    SELECT username INTO username FROM users WHERE id = user_id;
    RETURN username;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### Using Functions in Queries

```
SELECT GetUserName(1);
```

---

## 9. Triggers and Events

### Creating Triggers

```
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_user
BEFORE INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
END;
```

### Trigger Events

- **INSERT:** Triggered before or after an insert operation.
- **UPDATE:** Triggered before or after an update operation.
- **DELETE:** Triggered before or after a delete operation.

### Creating and Managing Events

```
CREATE EVENT my_event
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
DO
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;
END;
```

---

## 10. Transactions and Concurrency

### What are Transactions?

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.

### ACID Properties

- **Atomicity:** All operations in a transaction are completed; if not, the transaction is aborted.
- **Consistency:** The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other.
- **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, it remains so.

### COMMIT and ROLLBACK

```
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('jane_doe', 'jane@example.com');
COMMIT;

START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('jane_doe', 'jane@example.com');
ROLLBACK;
```

### Concurrency Control

- **Locking:** Prevents multiple transactions from accessing the same data simultaneously.
- **Isolation Levels:** Controls the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other transactions.

## 11. Security and User Management

### Creating and Managing Users

```
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

### Granting and Revoking Privileges

```
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON mydatabase.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
REVOKE INSERT ON mydatabase.* FROM 'newuser'@'localhost';
```

### Roles and Permissions

```
CREATE ROLE 'read_only';
GRANT SELECT ON mydatabase.* TO 'read_only';
GRANT 'read_only' TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
```

### Securing MySQL Server

- Use strong passwords.
- Limit access to the MySQL server.
- Regularly update MySQL to the latest version.

---

## 12. Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategies

- **Full Backup:** Backs up the entire database.
- **Incremental Backup:** Backs up only the changes since the last backup.

### Using mysqldump

```
mysqldump -u root -p mydatabase > mydatabase_backup.sql
```

### Restoring Databases

```
mysql -u root -p mydatabase < mydatabase_backup.sql
```

### Point-in-Time Recovery

```
mysqlbinlog --start-datetime="2023-10-01 00:00:00" --stop-datetime="2023-10-02 00:00:00" binlog.000001 | mysql -u root -p
```

---

## 13. Replication and Scaling

### What is Replication?

Replication is the process of copying data from one MySQL server to another.

### Setting Up Replication

1. Configure the master server.
2. Configure the slave server.
3. Start replication.

### Scaling MySQL

- **Read Replicas:** Distribute read queries across multiple servers.
- **Sharding:** Split data across multiple databases.

### Load Balancing

- Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple MySQL servers.

---

## 14. Advanced Features

### Full-Text Search

```
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH(title, body) AGAINST('MySQL');
```

### JSON Support

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.age') > 30;
```

### GIS (Geographic Information Systems) Support

```
SELECT * FROM locations WHERE ST_Distance_Sphere(point1, point2) < 1000;
```

### Partitioning Tables

```
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT,
    sale_date DATE
) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2022)
);
```

---

## 15. MySQL Performance Tuning

### Analyzing Query Performance

- Use the `EXPLAIN` statement to analyze query execution plans.
- Optimize slow queries by adding indexes or rewriting the query.

### Using EXPLAIN

```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```

### Optimizing Schema Design

- Normalize your database schema to reduce redundancy.
- Use appropriate data types for columns.

### Caching and Buffering

- Use query caching to store the results of frequently run queries.
- Configure the InnoDB buffer pool to cache data and indexes.
